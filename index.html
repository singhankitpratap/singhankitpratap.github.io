<h2>About me</h2>
Hello! I am Ankit Pratap Singh. I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.ece.iastate.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.iastate.edu/" target="_blank">Iowa State University</a>, advised by Professor <a href="https://www.ece.iastate.edu/~namrata/" target="_blank">Namrata Vaswani</a>. My research involves developing <b>robust machine learning, Compressive Sensing, and Reinforcement Learning (RL)</b>b> algorithms in the face of <b>Byzantine failures</b>. By leveraging Signal Processing, High Dimensional Probability and Linear Algebra, I aim to provide convergence guarantees, ensuring these algorithms perform accurately despite adversarial conditions. Additionally, I simulate these algorithms in <b>TensorFlow, PyTorch</b> to validate their robustness and efficiency under diverse scenarios.
