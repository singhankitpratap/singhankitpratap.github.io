<h2>About me</h2>
Hello! I am Ankit Pratap Singh. I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.ece.iastate.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.iastate.edu/" target="_blank">Iowa State University</a>, advised by Professor <a href="https://www.ece.iastate.edu/~namrata/" target="_blank">Namrata Vaswani</a>. My research interests lie in <b>federated machine learning, information theory, reinforcement learning, and compressive sensing</b>. Key contributions include developing a <a href="https://singhankitpratap.github.io/research/" target="_blank">Byzantine-resilient federated few-shot learning algorithm</a>, which uses <b>low-dimensional representation</b> for efficient learning from minimal data. I have also created a novel technique called <a href="https://singhankitpratap.github.io/research/" target="_blank">Subspace Median</a>, which enables <b>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</b> on distributed or federated datasets, even with up to 50% of the devices being corrupt. I'm proficient in simulating machine learning models using <b>TensorFlow and PyTorch</b> and have hands-on experience federating these models with <b>Docker Swarm</b> and deploying scalable solutions on <b>AWS</b>. I am continually seeking and open to collaborations on exciting projects.
