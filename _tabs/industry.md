## AI Researcher, Thoughtworks
Remote | 09/2025 – Present  

As part of the **AI research team**, I am developing a **multi-table Q&A data generation framework** using **LLM-guided SQL-template synthesis** and **GRPO-based reinforcement learning** to improve reasoning and data diversity across complex relational databases.  

**Key Skills:** Reinforcement Learning, Data Generation, SQL Synthesis, Multi-Table Reasoning  
**Technologies:** GRPO, Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, Python, PyTorch, pandas


## ML Researcher, International Finance Corporation (World Bank)
Washington, D.C. | 06/2025 – 09/2025  


Led the development of a **multi-agent (LLM) system** to extract structured insights from **semi-structured financial documents** such as loan memos and investor reports. Implemented a **graph-based traversal framework** to identify and tag tables, trace linked notes, and apply **model-guided explosion logic** for accurate and explainable parsing **reducing manual document review time**.  

Additionally, designed and deployed an **Early Warning System (EWS)** to detect projects with unusually long processing times in the **Mandate-to-Disbursement** cycle, delivering predictive insights that enabled proactive regional interventions and helped reduce the median timeline from **286 days** toward the **management target of 228 days**.  

**Key Skills:** Statistical Modeling, Data Analysis, Cross-Validation, Predictive Modeling, Multi-Agent Systems  
**Technologies:** LoRA, LangChain, Azure OCR, pandas, spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers
